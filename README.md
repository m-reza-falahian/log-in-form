# Log-in-form

Hi

This login project is designed so that you can use it customize for your own projects.But keep in mind that you have to make some changes to use it

# For test
1.start Apache and MariaDB(Mysql) on your pc

2.run this repository on localhost port 7000 with php

# Notes
* this form is not yet responsive
* To use this form in your sites you have to make changes to it for example, this project automatically creates a database for itself,but in the real project does not happen by login form.
